<div class="w3-container" style = "background-color:#2E2EFE; ">
	<p style = "margin-left: 0px;margin-right: 0px;"> Welcome. After spending many years of my life in International Baccalaureate (IB) as well as in Engineering
	School, I've found that although my studies present many technical challenges
	on a daily basis, finding a creative medium is a challenge in itself. Thus, I have
	created a compilation of both my technical achievements, as well as my side ambitions, 
	in addition to my thoughts on self-improvement, tech, the world
	as we know it, and anything else that may come to mind.</p> <p style = "margin-left: 0px;margin-right: 0px"> I'd like to thank you for
	visiting this site, and I hope that this method of creativity truly does impact you
	in one way or another: whether it's inspiration to make your own website, immediate repulsion
	by my content (if so, please send me your feedback!), or at the very least a break from
	your extremely busy day. </p>

	<h2 style = "color: white"> About </h2>
	</p> <h3> The Technical-Pitch </h3> <p> I am currently a Senior majoring in Electrical
	and Computer Engineering with a minor in Computer Science and a Leadership Certificate. 
	I currently attend the University of Colorado in the beautiful city of Boulder. In addition
	to my studies, I am currently a part of the Engineering Honors Program (EHP), the Engineering
	Leadership Program (ELP), the Esteemed Scholars Program (James H. Baker), and Broadening Opportunities
	through Leadership and Diversity (BOLD).</p> <p> Over the course of the past years of school, I have been
	primarily trained in Embedded Software, Linear Systems, Microelectronics, Digital Logic, Computer Organization/Microarchitecture,
	Operating Systems, Data Structures, Algorithms, Control Systems, and Digital Signal Processing. </p> <p>Further, I have also held internships at many different
	companies. My first internship was at DragonDev, a local Boulder start-up, where I worked as a Junior Developer
	and helped research, design, and develop business applications while also working on the HTML and CSS for the company's 
	website. Next up, I worked as an IT Intern at Hunter Douglas in Broomfield, Colorado. Here, I was assigned the task to
	synchonize the company and dealer database using programmatic solutions in C++, iMacro, Unix, and Excel. Most 
	recently, I interned at Intel Corporation in Fort Collins, Colorado. I worked on two Validation projects,
	the first where I analyzed Isolation Strategies between Power Domains in UPF, and the second where I found
	errors in RTL Functionality using X-Propogation. Both of these projects were done using DVE and Verdi. I
	found that I enjoyed this internship so much, and thus I will be working full-time at Intel in Hillsboro, Oregon. Really looking forward to it.</p> 
	
	<h3> The Non-Technical Pitch </h3>
	<p>Besides my full-time job as a student, I am extremely involved in the Society of Women Engineers (SWE).
	I have held leadership positions as the Director of K-12 Outreach, the University of Colorado Engineering Council 
	and Student Learning Center Representative, and (currently) Vice President of the Chapter. Beyond SWE, I am very
	passionate about Dance; I was previously on the Verve Collisonz Hip-Hop Team at CU, and since then have had the opportunity
	to perform Bollywood, a dance form blending hip-hop and Indian Culture, and Bharatanatyam, an Indian Classical Dance, on many occasions. 
	I have served as a "Toon Leader," analogous to Learning Assistant, for the Gateway to Leadership Course, a fundamental course as part of ELP,
	as well as a "Recitation Leader," also analogous to Learning Assistant, for EHP. Both of these positions involved organizing weekly
	recitations with a group of 6-7 students in order to further discuss concepts, and to allow students a platform to share their
	thoughts. I have also previously worked as a tutor as part of the Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering Department's Knowledge Foundry
	program. I assisted students here with Circuits 1, Intro to Programming in C and MATLAB, and Digital Logic. </p>
	
	<p> In my spare time, I very much enjoy hiking, photography/film, movies, and learning new things. </p>
